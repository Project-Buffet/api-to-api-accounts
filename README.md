# api-to-api-accounts
This integration takes a set of Account objects from one Mock REST API and inserts them into another "destination" Mock REST API. This project can be repurposed for any data type beyond just Accounts. Be sure to clear the REST API of Accounts before moving the data.

This project requires creating 2 Mock REST APIs - one to pass the data from and a "destination" API to pass the data to. This is the site I use to create mock API endpoints: https://mockapi.io/projects
